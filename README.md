# arduino-home-automation-house
Personal and final project for the subject of Wireless Sensor Networks. 
The project is based on two ESP32-S2 boards with Arduino programs. Both are connected to the Wi-Fi network and are controlled from a web server. One of the panels is responsible for managing LEDs and the door of a parking lot. The other has a temperature and humidity sensor connected that sends the data to a mySQL database using PHP.
